### Forecast Summary:
For this week's forecast I determined 1-week and 2-week forecast esimates of 103 cfs and 104 cfs. These values were determined by analyzing flow data from a dataframe as well as the use of for loops, lists, and conditional statements to select dates and value ranges of desired observations within the same month of October in previous years to serve as reasonable comparisons to estimate 1-week and 2-week flow values. 
Code Revision included using linter to fix mistakes and improve code readability.
