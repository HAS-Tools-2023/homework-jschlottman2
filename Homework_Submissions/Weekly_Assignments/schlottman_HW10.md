3/3: Nice work. Very glad that you found the review helpful. Many others are also confused on functions so don't worry we will continue practicing with them. 

## Reflection:
This week I determined 1-week and 2-week forecast estimates of 112 cfs and 121 cfs.
Although I found some of the content a bit confusing and challenging, especially within the excercises, I feel like I did learn quite a bit and feel much more confident and comfortable simply working with code and creating new functions.
I do still struggle mainly with writing new functions, their syntax, and what to include as arguments when and where. I'm quite glad that we altered the course plans to include this week of review, as I found it extremely helpful and would absolutely reccomend that it continue to be incorporated in future class sessions.
