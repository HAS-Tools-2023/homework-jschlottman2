## Assignment Summary:
For this week's forecast I determined 1-week and 2-week forecast esimates of 136.225 cfs and 154.821 cfs using Pandas Dataframes and functions to return reasonable estimate values.
## Questions: 
1. The data frame is based on a pandas dataframe created in the starter code titled 'data'. Columns are named 'agency_cd', 'site_no', 'datetie', 'flow', and 'code'.  Index for columns are data[:,0] to data[:,4]. 
Data types are string, int, datetime, int, and string.

2. The flow column includes a list of integers representing measured flow values in cfs.
