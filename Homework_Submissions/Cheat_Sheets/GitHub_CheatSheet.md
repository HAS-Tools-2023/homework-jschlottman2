### GitHub Cheatsheet for personal reference

### Define GitHub and Git:
GitHub is a cooperative cloud platform which allows developers to interactively share, edit, and view working codes and scripts for software development and version control. Git is the base system which GitHub operates on and is a system of version control which tracks changes on any number of computers, allowing contributors to edit and develop software cooperatively.
### What is a repo and how is it different from a folder?:
A repo is a shortened term which is slang for 'repository'. A repository  is a centralized storage location used to access and manage source code. Repositories can be stored locally or access online to those who have acess when pushed to a sharing system such as GitHub. Repo's are different from standard folders in that they contain a hidden processing '.git' file inside the working dirctory unlike normal folders. 
### Local, remote, and origin:
 are terms related to the location of repo's. Local means that it is stored on your personal computer and stored in your local files. Remote refers to the repo space within the cloud that is not stored locally on your computer and is visible and accessible to anyone with permission to view and acess. The origin is a name given to the source of information as a remote repository that holds the data prior to pulling it down to your local repo.
###  There are several ways to produce your own version of a repo. 
Common actions are to clone and to fork a repository. Cloning refers to making a copy from the remote repo and esentially pasting it as a copy in your local repo. To fork is to create a new repo to iterate on changes before they are proposed to the upstream repo.
### When adding changes in your repo there are several steps and methods. 
To stage means you mark a modified file prior to next step of commiting. Committing records changes to files in your branch. Finally, we push changes and updates which reflects the changes made on your local repo to the remote repo after being pushed.
### To view changes or updates made remotely on your local repo, you need to pull or fetch. 
Pulling creates an up-to-date version of all the files on the remote repo on your local repo so that you may edit and view them as a local version on your own pc. Fetching is a partial action similar to a pull. To sum i up in simper terms, pulling is composed of a fetch and merges. Fetching is like cloning branches rather than an entire repository.
### Branches are essentially individual projects or components within a git repository. 
New branches are created from already existing branches. Branching allows us to experiment and develop changes, fix bugs, etc. Useful for forming ideas and writing new code.
### Pull requests involve notifying collaboraters about potentail changes.
 Opening a pull request allows for collaberation and adding additional commits prior to changes actually being merged.
