**GitHub**: 8/10 
- Good job but there was no formatting on your submission at all, so it was just a wall of text and very hard to read and separate out. The purpose of the cheet sheet is to provide a reference for yourself. It doesn't matter to me how its organized visually but at a minimum you need to do some formatting so it will serve as an easy reference to you going forward. 
-  Also please review your definitions for forking and fetching vs pulling. Those were both a little off. Happy to help clarify either of those definitions if you would like just stop by my office hours. 


**Pandas and Numpy**: 
8/10: Nice work but I took of points for two reasons: 
1. you don't have any formatting other than your two headers in this file which makes it very hard to read. Next time be sure to add more formatting to make it easier to distinguish questions and answers. 
2. You have listed several functions but you don't actually have examples here of how to use them and what their arguments are.
