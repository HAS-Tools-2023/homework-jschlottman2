- Good job but there was no formatting on your submission at all, so it was just a wall of text and very hard to read and separate out. The purpose of the cheet sheet is to provide a reference for yourself. It doesn't matter to me how its organized visually but at a minimum you need to do some formatting so it will serve as an easy reference to you going forward. 
-  Also please review your definitions for forking and fetching vs pulling. Those were both a little off. Happy to help clarify either of those definitions if you would like just stop by my office hours.
