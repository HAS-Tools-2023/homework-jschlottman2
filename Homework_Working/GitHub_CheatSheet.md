### GitHub Cheatsheet for personal reference

i. Define GitHub and Git:
GitHub is a cooperative cloud platform which allows developers to interactively share, edit, and view working codes and scripts for software development and version control. Git is the base system which GitHub operates on and is a system of version control which tracks changes on any number of computers, allowing contributors to edit and develop software cooperatively.
ii. What is a repo and how is it different from a folder?:
A repo is a shortened term which is slang for 'repository'. A repository  is a centralized storage location used to access and manage source code. Repositories can be stored locally or access online to those who have acess when pushed to a sharing system such as GitHub. Repo's are different from standard folders in that they contain a hidden processing '.git' file inside the working dirctory unlike normal folders.
