## Assignment Summary:
For this week's forecast I determined 1-week and 2-week forecast esimates of 136.225 cfs and 154.821 cfs using Pandas Dataframes and functions to return reasonable estimate values.
### Questions: 
1. The data frame is based on a pandas dataframe created in the starter code titled 'data'. Columns are named 'agency_cd', 'site_no', 'datetime', 'flow', and 'code'.  Index is 12698.
Data types: 'agency_cd' = object, 'site_no'= int, 'datetime'= object, 'flow'= float, and 'code'= object. 

2. The flow column includes data used for a flow summary with representative measured flow values in cfs, which are all either integers or floats.
